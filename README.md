# Bash_Exercise_2
More exercises in basic Bash scripting based on the scenarios from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/bash-script-exercises/understanding-basic-commands.php).

## 1. Echo Command Basics

Write a Bash script that uses the echo command to print "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

<details>

```
#!bin/bash
echo Hello, World!
```
**Things to remember**: 
- Backslash to escape special characters if I want to preserve double quotations on the screen output: echo \"Hello, World!\";
- Single quotes are also possible, but a single quote within single quotes cannot be escaped: \'It\'s a me!\';
- Quotes are not necessary for simple text. Text within double quotes ignores some special symbols, while text within single quotes ignores all special symbols.
